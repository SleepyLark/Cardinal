# Cardinal
A virtual deck of cards in Java

## Overview
Just a side-project I'm doing to practice with Java. Nothing too serious

### Possible Plans
* Implement other card games like Pokemon TCG and Magic (Needs some kind of database since I'm too lazy to do it myself. Most likely will require learning SQL)
* Have an actual GUI (probably will use JavaFX since I need to learn that)
* Net-play (highly unlikely)
* Migrating to a better language than Java
